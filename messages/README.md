# A SIMPLE MESSAGE API

> This is a kinda dummy API but important since it was a task I was given as an assessment for a job I wasn't selected for.

#### I was asked to implement an API that:

- Allows a token authenicated individual to send a message
- Restrict the number of messages that can be sent to 10/hr.
- Generates a token for a registered user.

> The caveat I had here was trying to prevent the API from crashing when a user sends an empty message.
